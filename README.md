# Class-Schedule-Generator
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description
This project serves as my final project for CS50x. It generates a class schedule for you in a Word file. The project was made with Python and QT library (PyQT6). 
The GUI was made with the help of QT Designer. 

## Background
I decided to create this project because I wanted something practical; something I could use throughout my college life. At first, my plan was to create a student utility
tool consisting of a to-do list and a schedule generator, then I realized that it's hard for me to do that because I struggled in using QT Designer, so I decided to start 
small for now. I went on to create this Class Schedule Generator instead. 

## Usage
When running the program for the first time, make sure to execute *installRequirements.py* first to install the necessary modules in order to run the program (Make sure you have Python of version 3.10 or above
installed). Execute *mainGUI.py* afterwards.

Running the program again only requires you to execute *mainGUI.py*.
